In case of submitted invalid parameters, throw an error. Finally, return the changed array of flowers as a string, joined by " / ".


Unit tests: 
- Initialization:
test with types object and function;

- Calculation price method:
Throws errors for invalid arguments, returns correct result in normal cases, returns correct results for 0, works with empty strings, works with negative numbers, can be called multiple times;

- Sell flowers method:
Returns correct result with an array with 3+ elements, returns correct result with an array with 2 elements, returns correct result with an array of a single element, throws errors with invalid arguments;
